### Dependencies

- OpenGL 3.2
- [tiffgl](https://github.com/tiffany352/tiffgl)
- [libepoxy](https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy) (default) or [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) (requires a special flag)
- [libpng](http://libpng.org/)

### Building

Build files for tup are provided.

Manual builds must satisfy the following:

- The 'src' directory must be on the include path
- Each dependency must be on the include path
- TiffGL requires you to decide whether you are using libepoxy or
  GLFW through a compiler define
- It is preferred to create statically linked libraries for IL, as it
  is not ABI or API compatible between versions. You should vendor
  this repository as a submodule.
- Code should be compiled as C with -std=gnu99.
